# Lesson 1: Introduction to Numbers

Welcome to your first lesson! Let's start from the very beginning.

## What Are Numbers?

Numbers are symbols we use to count, measure, and calculate. Let's explore different types of numbers.

### 1. Natural Numbers (Counting Numbers)
These are the numbers you use to count objects:
- **Examples:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...
- **Use:** Counting apples, people, cars, etc.

### 2. Whole Numbers
Natural numbers plus zero:
- **Examples:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
- **Use:** Same as natural numbers, but includes "nothing" (zero)

### 3. Integers
Whole numbers plus negative numbers:
- **Examples:** ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
- **Positive integers:** 1, 2, 3, ... (above zero)
- **Negative integers:** -1, -2, -3, ... (below zero)
- **Use:** Temperature (below/above zero), bank balance (debt/credit)

### 4. Fractions
Numbers that represent parts of a whole:
- **Form:** $\frac{numerator}{denominator}$
- **Examples:** $\frac{1}{2}$ (one half), $\frac{3}{4}$ (three quarters), $\frac{5}{8}$
- **Parts:**
  - **Numerator** (top): How many parts you have
  - **Denominator** (bottom): How many parts make a whole

**Example:** $\frac{3}{4}$ means you have 3 parts out of 4 equal parts.

### 5. Decimals
Another way to write fractions, using a decimal point:
- **Examples:** 0.5, 1.25, 3.14, 0.75
- **Relationship to fractions:**
  - $0.5 = \frac{1}{2}$
  - $0.25 = \frac{1}{4}$
  - $0.75 = \frac{3}{4}$

### 6. Rational Numbers
Any number that can be written as a fraction (including integers and decimals that end or repeat):
- **Examples:** $\frac{2}{3}$, $5$ (which is $\frac{5}{1}$), $0.333...$ (repeating), $2.5$

### 7. Real Numbers
All the numbers on the number line:
- Includes: integers, fractions, decimals, and irrational numbers (like $\pi$ = 3.14159... and $\sqrt{2}$ = 1.41421...)

## The Number Line

Visualize numbers on a line:

```
        -3    -2    -1     0     1     2     3     4
    ----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---->
  (negative)         (zero)         (positive)
```

- **Left of zero:** Negative numbers (getting smaller)
- **Zero:** The middle point
- **Right of zero:** Positive numbers (getting larger)

## Important Concepts

### Absolute Value
The distance from zero (always positive):
- $|5| = 5$
- $|-5| = 5$
- $|0| = 0$

### Comparing Numbers
- **Greater than (>):** 5 > 3 (5 is greater than 3)
- **Less than (<):** 2 < 7 (2 is less than 7)
- **Equal to (=):** 4 = 4 (4 equals 4)

### Signs
- **Positive (+):** Numbers greater than zero (usually written without the + sign)
- **Negative (-):** Numbers less than zero (always written with the - sign)
- **Zero:** Neither positive nor negative

## Key Takeaways

1. **Natural numbers** are for counting (1, 2, 3, ...)
2. **Integers** include negative numbers and zero
3. **Fractions** represent parts of a whole
4. **Decimals** are another way to write fractions
5. **The number line** helps visualize relationships between numbers

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll learn how to **multiply** these numbers together!
