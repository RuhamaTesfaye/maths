## 🔑 Key Concepts Summary

### Regular Numbers
- **Multiplication:** Repeated addition; same signs → positive, different signs → negative
- **Division:** Inverse of multiplication; "Keep, Change, Flip" for fractions

### Complex Numbers
- **Form:** $z = a + bi$ where $i^2 = -1$
- **Multiplication:** Use FOIL, replace $i^2$ with $-1$
- **Division:** Multiply by conjugate of denominator

---

## 💡 Quick Reference Formulas

### Essential Formulas:

**Complex Number Operations:**
- $(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i$
- $(a + bi)(c + di)$ → Use FOIL
- $\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \frac{a + bi}{c + di} \times \frac{c - di}{c - di}$

**Special Properties:**
- $i^2 = -1$
- $(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2$
- $|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

---
