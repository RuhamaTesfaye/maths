# Lesson 3: Dividing Regular Numbers

Welcome to division! This is the opposite operation of multiplication.

## What Is Division?

**Division** is splitting a number into equal parts or finding how many times one number fits into another.

**Example:**
- If you have 12 cookies and want to share them equally among 4 friends
- $12 \div 4 = 3$ (each friend gets 3 cookies)

### Division Symbols
- $12 \div 4$ (division sign)
- $\frac{12}{4}$ (fraction form)
- $12 / 4$ (slash)
- All mean: "12 divided by 4"

### Division Terminology
$$\frac{\text{dividend}}{\text{divisor}} = \text{quotient}$$

- **Dividend:** The number being divided (12)
- **Divisor:** The number you're dividing by (4)
- **Quotient:** The answer (3)

## Relationship Between Division and Multiplication

Division is the **inverse** of multiplication:
- If $3 \times 4 = 12$, then $12 \div 4 = 3$ and $12 \div 3 = 4$

**Check your division:** Multiply the quotient by the divisor to get the dividend
- $12 \div 4 = 3$ → Check: $3 \times 4 = 12$ ✓

## Dividing Whole Numbers

### Basic Division Facts

Learn these division facts (they're the inverse of multiplication tables):
- $12 \div 3 = 4$ (because $3 \times 4 = 12$)
- $24 \div 6 = 4$ (because $6 \times 4 = 24$)
- $56 \div 8 = 7$ (because $8 \times 7 = 56$)

### Properties of Division

#### 1. Identity Property
Dividing by 1 doesn't change the number:
- $8 \div 1 = 8$

#### 2. Dividing by Itself
Any number divided by itself equals 1:
- $7 \div 7 = 1$

#### 3. Zero Rules
- $0 \div 5 = 0$ (zero divided by anything is zero)
- $5 \div 0 = $ **UNDEFINED** (can't divide by zero!)

**Why can't we divide by zero?** 
If $5 \div 0 = x$, then $0 \times x = 5$. But zero times anything is zero, not 5. It's impossible!

#### 4. NOT Commutative
Order matters in division:
- $12 \div 3 = 4$
- $3 \div 12 = 0.25$
- They're NOT equal!

## Long Division

For larger numbers, we use long division.

### Example 1: $156 \div 12$

```
      13
   ------
12 | 156
     12↓   (12 × 1 = 12)
     ---
      36   (15 - 12 = 3, bring down 6)
      36   (12 × 3 = 36)
     ---
       0   (36 - 36 = 0)
```

**Answer:** $156 \div 12 = 13$

### Example 2: $487 \div 15$

```
      32 R7
   ---------
15 | 487
     45↓    (15 × 3 = 45)
     ---
      37    (48 - 45 = 3, bring down 7)
      30    (15 × 2 = 30)
     ---
       7    (37 - 30 = 7, remainder)
```

**Answer:** $487 \div 15 = 32$ remainder $7$

Or as a mixed number: $32\frac{7}{15}$

Or as a decimal: $32.4\overline{6}$ (approximately 32.47)

## Dividing Negative Numbers

### Rules for Signs (Same as Multiplication!)

1. **Positive ÷ Positive = Positive**
   - $12 \div 4 = 3$

2. **Negative ÷ Negative = Positive**
   - $(-12) \div (-4) = 3$

3. **Positive ÷ Negative = Negative**
   - $12 \div (-4) = -3$

4. **Negative ÷ Positive = Negative**
   - $(-12) \div 4 = -3$

**Memory Tip:** 
- Same signs → Positive result
- Different signs → Negative result

### Examples
- $(-20) \div (-5) = 4$ ✓
- $(-20) \div 5 = -4$ ✓
- $20 \div (-5) = -4$ ✓
- $20 \div 5 = 4$ ✓

## Dividing Fractions

### The Rule: Multiply by the Reciprocal

**Reciprocal:** Flip the fraction (swap numerator and denominator)
- Reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{3}$
- Reciprocal of $\frac{2}{5}$ is $\frac{5}{2}$

**Division becomes multiplication:**
$$\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{d}{c}$$

### Memory Trick: "Keep, Change, Flip"
1. **Keep** the first fraction
2. **Change** division to multiplication
3. **Flip** the second fraction

### Examples

**Example 1:** $\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{4}{5}$

$$\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{4} = \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6}$$

**Example 2:** $\frac{3}{4} \div \frac{1}{2}$

$$\frac{3}{4} \div \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{1} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2} = 1\frac{1}{2}$$

**Example 3:** $\frac{5}{6} \div \frac{2}{3}$

$$\frac{5}{6} \div \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{15}{12} = \frac{5}{4} = 1\frac{1}{4}$$

### Dividing by a Whole Number

Convert the whole number to a fraction first:
$$\frac{3}{4} \div 2 = \frac{3}{4} \div \frac{2}{1} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{8}$$

### Dividing Mixed Numbers

Convert to improper fractions first:

**Example:** $2\frac{1}{2} \div 1\frac{1}{4}$

1. Convert: $2\frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2}$ and $1\frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}$
2. Apply rule: $\frac{5}{2} \div \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{20}{10} = 2$

## Dividing Decimals

### Case 1: Dividing by a Whole Number

**Example:** $12.6 \div 3$

```
    4.2
  ------
3 | 12.6
    12
    ---
     0.6
     0.6
     ---
       0
```

Place the decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal in the dividend.

### Case 2: Dividing by a Decimal

**Make the divisor a whole number** by moving the decimal point.

**Example:** $4.8 \div 0.6$

1. Move decimal in 0.6 one place right → 6
2. Move decimal in 4.8 one place right → 48
3. Now divide: $48 \div 6 = 8$

**Example:** $7.2 \div 0.03$

1. Move decimal in 0.03 two places right → 3
2. Move decimal in 7.2 two places right → 720
3. Now divide: $720 \div 3 = 240$

### Case 3: Continuing Division for More Decimal Places

**Example:** $7 \div 4$

```
    1.75
  ------
4 | 7.00
    4
    ---
    30
    28
    ---
     20
     20
     ---
      0
```

Add zeros after the decimal point and continue dividing.

## Quick Tips & Tricks

### Dividing by 10, 100, 1000
- **By 10:** Move decimal point 1 place left → $34.5 \div 10 = 3.45$
- **By 100:** Move decimal point 2 places left → $345 \div 100 = 3.45$
- **By 1000:** Move decimal point 3 places left → $3450 \div 1000 = 3.45$

### Dividing by 5
Multiply by 2, then divide by 10:
- $230 \div 5 = (230 \times 2) \div 10 = 460 \div 10 = 46$

### Checking Your Work
Always multiply the quotient by the divisor:
- If $24 \div 6 = 4$, then $4 \times 6 = 24$ ✓

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Mistake 1:** Forgetting to flip when dividing fractions
- Wrong: $\frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}$
- Right: $\frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{1} = \frac{3}{2}$

❌ **Mistake 2:** Misplacing the decimal point
- Wrong: $12.6 \div 3 = 0.42$
- Right: $12.6 \div 3 = 4.2$

❌ **Mistake 3:** Sign errors
- Wrong: $(-20) \div (-4) = -5$
- Right: $(-20) \div (-4) = 5$ (same signs = positive)

❌ **Mistake 4:** Thinking division is commutative
- Wrong: $12 \div 3 = 3 \div 12$
- Right: $12 \div 3 = 4$, but $3 \div 12 = 0.25$

## Special Cases

### Division with Remainders
- $17 \div 5 = 3$ remainder $2$
- As a fraction: $3\frac{2}{5}$
- As a decimal: $3.4$

### Repeating Decimals
- $1 \div 3 = 0.\overline{3}$ (0.333... forever)
- $2 \div 3 = 0.\overline{6}$ (0.666... forever)
- $1 \div 7 = 0.\overline{142857}$ (repeating pattern)

## Key Takeaways

1. Division is the **inverse of multiplication**
2. **Same signs** → positive; **different signs** → negative
3. For fractions: **Keep, Change, Flip** (multiply by reciprocal)
4. For decimals: **Make divisor whole**, then divide
5. **Cannot divide by zero!**
6. Check your work by multiplying
